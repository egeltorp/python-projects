# 🐍 Python Projects

This is my collection of small, personal Python projects — mostly for learning, experimentation, and fun.  
Each project is contained in a single `.py` file with a clean command-line interface.

## 🚀 Projects Included

- 🎲 Egeltorp's Toolbox (toolbox.py)

More coming soon...

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- No external libraries needed (unless specified per project)

## ▶️ How to Run
Download any .py file and run from the Terminal. 
Example:
    `> Python3 toolbox.py`

To Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/python-projects.git
cd python-projects
